    <td>Devil Man CryBaby
        <p>Akira's best friend tells him that ancient demons have returned
             to take back the world from humans and suggests that he unite 
             with a demon. Akira successfully does that, transforming into Devilman
              a being with a demon's powers but who retains the soul of a human. 
              This sends Akira into a brutal, degenerate war against evil. With fear 
              of demons gripping the world, humanity devolves into paranoia and violence
               and Akira sets out to save other demon-human hybrids like himself..</p>
