 <h1>Brief Introduction</h1>
 <p>I am Sebastian Axl G. Cruz,16 years old and my nickname is Baste. I love playing videogames
  since im a child we have playstation 2 thatâ€™s the time that my life is dedicate to a
  videogame. I like it because it reach beyond my imagination like a Magic and Rpg and any
  other game that it will shock you because its good and you can have some fun.</p>
  <h1>Why did you enroll as an ICT student? Why not other track or strands?</h1>
  <p>Because it is connected to a Game and Computer. And I know this is the strand that I will not
    stress because I like all about how computer made or how game made, and this is the strand
    that can make my dream job come true</p>

 <h1>What is your dream job? How do you think will this course will help you in
 pursuing your career?</h1>
 <p>Gusto ko maging computer engineering o kaya maging game developer kaya ako ay
  nag aral sa ICT strand alam kong mas mapapadali dahil tungkol ito sa computer at
  coding pero d ko ineexpect na may math pa din pala sa ICT strand.</p>
<h1>To whom are you dedicating your success in finishing course? Yourself, family,
  friends, special someone etc. Why?</h1>
  <p>Sa aking mga magulang dahil sila ang bumubuhay sa akin at laging sinasabi ng aking
    magulang na pagbutihan ko lang daw kahit magkano pa daw ang tuition ay babaran
    nila basta suklian ko lang sila ng magandang grado at makapagtapos</p>
